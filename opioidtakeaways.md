# Opioids in cancer pain

- Pain is an important concern among patients living with cancer and seriously affects quality of life. 
- Uncontrolled pain is associated with limited activities in daily life, negative emotion, poor sleep and spiritual distress.
- The principles of pain control in cancer are well established and guidelines are available such as the [Malaysian Cancer Pain Clinical Practice Guideline](https://www.moh.gov.my/moh/resources/Penerbitan/CPG/Kanser/e-CPG_Management_of_Cancer_Pain_(Second_Edition%29_8_8_24.pdf) 

This short module highlights 10 important points about opioid prescribing in cancer pain in the form of multiple choice questions.

- Cancer pain is common and frequently uncrecognised.
- Proper assessment is essential
- The WHO analgesic ladder guides treatment
- Oral morphine is the preferred opioid in moderate to severe pain among **patients with cancer**
- Rescue analgesics are an important element of pain control
- Caution is required in renal and hepatic impairment
- Adjuvant medications need to be considered according
- Non-pharmacological interventions need to be considered
- Specialist referral is needed when pain control is not achieved
- Follow up needs to be arranged

## Prevalence of pain

How common is cancer pain generally?

[( )] 90% of patients on diagnosis
[( )] 10% during anticancer treatment
[(x)] 38.0% of all patients experience moderate to severe pain
[( )] 2% after curative treatment
*** 
Based on a 2016 [meta-analysis](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0885-3924(16%2930048-3) pain affects 39.3% of patients after curative treatment; 55.0% of patients during anticancer treatment and 66.4% in advanced, metastatic or terminal disease. Moderate to severe pain affected 38.0% of all patients.
***

According to [Global Cancer Observatory of the World Health Organization (WHO)](https://gco.iarc.who.int/media/globocan/factsheets/populations/458-malaysia-fact-sheet.pdf) there were 51,650 new diagnoses of cancer in Malaysia in 2022 and the need for expanding palliative care services to address population needs has been [acknowledged](https://www.moh.gov.my/moh/resources/Polisi/BUKU_NATIONAL_PALLIATIVE_CARE_POLICY_AND_STRATEGY_PLAN_2019-2030.pdf) by the Ministry of Health.

An important barrier to better pain control among cancer patients appears to relate to physicians and patient attitudes towards opioids.

Which is the most common concern among physicians?

[( )] Concerns about addiction
[( )] Concerns about legality
[(x)] Lack of knowledge
***
In one Malaysian [study](https://karger.com/ocl/article-abstract/74/Suppl.%201/24/238162/Improving-Cancer-Pain-Management-in-Malaysia?redirectedFrom=fulltext) 46% felt they lacked knowledge, 40% were concerned about addicition and 38% were concerned about legal issues.
***

Which is the most common concern among patients?

[( )] Addiction
[( )] Side effects
[(x)] Belief that opioids are only for terminal cases
***
In the same study 62% felt opioids were only for terminal cases, 54% feared adverse effects and 48% were concerned about becoming addicted.
***

## Pain assessment

Pain assessment is an imortant part of pain management. Several tools are available for different circumstances. Identifying the correct tool is a crucial step and familiarity with tools essential.

Match the situation to the most appropriate pain assessment instrument.

[[Numeric Rating Scale] (Visual Rating Scale) (FLACC) (Faces Pain Scale)]
[    ( )           ( )             (X)     ( )  ]  A 90 year old female with advanced dementia who is aphasic
[    (X)           ( )             ( )     ( )  ]  A 59 year old healthcare professional 
[    ( )           ( )             ( )     (X)  ]  A 4 year old child   



## WHO ladder

According to the WHO analgesic ladder which combination of analgesics is **NOT** recommended.

[( )] Morphine, paracetamol
[( )] Fentanyl patch and gabapentin tablet
[( )] Oxycodone orally, etoricoxib and gabapentin
[(x)] Fentanyl patch and oral tramadol


Which statement about the application of the WHO analgesic ladder in palliative care is **NOT** true?

[( )] Analgesics should be given orally when possible.
[( )] Analgesics should be given at fixed intervals.
[( )] Analgesic therapy should be individualised in terms of pain type and response to drug.
[(X)] Patients should never "descend" on the ladder to a lower step.
***
Analgesic treatment requires regular review including reduction or discontinuation of a drug for example when the underlying cause of the pain has resolved.
***

Which statement comparing morphine and tramadol is **NOT** true?

[( )] Both exhibit typical opioid adverse effects such as nausea, dizziness and dry mouth.
[( )] Both can be combined with paracetamol for better pain relief.
[(X)] Both can be given according to regular schedule and when needed (PRN) up to every hour.
[( )] Compared with morphine tramadol may act through more pharmacodynamic mechanisms.
***
The dosing schedule for tramadol does **NOT** include the option for additional doses (PRN) in addition to the regular doses.
***

## Oral morphine is the first line

Which is **NOT** a consideration in favour of using oral syrup morphine?

[( )] Lower risk of excessive drowsiness compared to injectable morphine
[( )] More flexibility in dose titration compared to tablet dosing
[( )] Lower cost due to extemporaneous compounding
[(X)] Less frequent dosing compared with modified release morphine tablets
***
The standard dosing interval for aqueous morphine is 4-hourly whereas modified release morphine tablets are given 12-hourly.
***


## Rescue analgesia

A single dose of rescue analgesia (PRN) should be what fraction of the total daily opioid dose usually?

[( )] 25 %
[(x)] $\frac{1}{12}$ to $\frac{1}{6}$
[( )] 50 %
[( )] 5 %
***
For the commonly used starting dose of aqueous morphine 5 mg Q4H (assuming normal kidney and liver function in an opioid naive patient) a dose of 5 mg aqueous morphine should be prescribed.
***

A patient on aqueous morphine 10 mg Q4H has been found to require on average 3 breakthrough doses per day over the past week. Which adjustment to his dosing is appropriate?

[( )] aqueous morphine 20 mg Q4H and 10 mg PRN
[( )] aqueous morphine 10 mg Q4H and 15 mg PRN
[(x)] aqueous morphine 15 mg Q4H and 15 mg PRN
[( )] aqueous morphine 20 mg Q4H and 20 mg PRN
***
**Calculation**:


Previous regular dose + total of PRN doses required = **New total daily dose**

60 mg (15 mg Q4H) + 30 mg (10 mg three times) = 90 mg per day (15 mg Q4H)

Do not forget to adjust the PRN dose according to the regular dose, hence the new prescription is:

**aqueous morphine 15 mg Q4H and 15 mg PRN**
***


## Caution in liver and kidney impairment


Which is **NOT** a recommendation in preventing adverse effects in liver and kidney impairment?

[(x)] avoid using opioids
[( )] increase dosing interval
[( )] reduce dosage
[( )] arrange close monitoring for adverse effects


Which strong opioid is comparatively **least** likely to cause adverse effects in advanced renal impairment?

[(x)] fentanyl
[( )] oxycodone
[( )] morphine
[( )] hydromorphone

## Adjuvant medications
Which matching of mechanism with adjuvant medication is **NOT** correct?

[( )] spinal cord edema and corticosteroid
[( )] nerve damage and gabapentin
[( )] smooth muscle spasm and hyoscine butylbromide
[(X)] chemotherapy-related neuropathy and benzodiazepine


## Psychoeducation, psychological and spiritual support

Match the intervention with its description:

[[Mindfulness] (Dignity therapy) (Cognitive behaviour therapy) (Logotherapy)]
[    ( )           ( )             (X)     ( )  ]  A pyschotherapy which aims to challenge unhelpful and irrational thoughts and beliefs
[    (X)           ( )             ( )     ( )  ]  A psychotherapy focusing on paying attention on purpose in the moment 
[    ( )           (X)             ( )     ( )  ]  A psychotherapy encouraging patients to talk about their lives and create a "legacy" document   
[    ( )           ( )             ( )     (X)  ]  A psychotherapy focusing on a search for meaning  



## Specialist referral in poorly controlled pain

Which scenario least warrants referral to specialist palliative care?

[(X)] Pain suboptimally controlled with syrup morphine 5 mg Q4H (requiring 4 breakthrough doses daily)
[( )] Pain poorly responsive to opioids despite several steps of titration and opioid rotation (change to different strong opioid)
[( )] Pain associated with new-onset lower limb weakness and a sensory level in the context of spinal metastasis
[( )] Pain associated with profound existential distress and patient expressing hopelessness and loss of meaning in life


## Outpatient follow up

The following are reasonable post discharge plans for patients commenced on oral morphine in hospital and discharged to their own home, except:

[( )] referral to hospice service in community
[(x)] aiming to taper and discontinue morphine prior to discharge
[( )] telehealth follow up
[( )] referral to nearby Klinik Kesihatan using the official referral form
