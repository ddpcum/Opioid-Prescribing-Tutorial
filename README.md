# Introduction

Cancer accounted for over 10% of all medically-certified deaths in Malaysia, in 2021.

For those living with cancer, pain is a common and distressing symptom that affects their quality of life.

Pain is defined as “an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage”

Cancer pain or cancer-related pain is pain experienced by patients with cancer due to cancer itself or its treatment

Vital signs are not the most reliable indicator for a person’s pain score. Patient’s self-report is the gold standard in the measurement of pain score.

The main barriers to effective pain control in Malaysia relate to physicians’ and patients’ attitudes towards the use of opioids. 
- 46% felt they lacked the knowledge to manage patients with severe pain
- 40% were concerned about opioid addiction 
- 38% were worried about legal issues.

Poor pain management in patients is due to
1. Ignorance 
2. Inexperience 
3. Overwork 
4. Traditional fears related to opioids, including fear of addiction and fear of side effects like respiratory depression 
5. Failure of patients to ask for pain relief 

Thus pain should be routinely assessed at regular interval as the 5th vital sign during routine observation to advocate “Pain as the 5th Vital Sign” initative.

We can do pain scoring by using pain assessment tool that is recommended for use in our hospitals is the Ministry of Health (MOH) pain scale, a scale that combines NRS, the VAS and faces scale for a more comprehensive assessment.

## Approach to Pain Management

## Non Pharmacological Management

1. Physiotherapy such as rest cold compression, stretching and strengthening exercises

2. Psychological therapy including addressing the pain and giving reassurance

3. Occupational therapy such as modifications of activities of daily living, play, leisure and work

4. Traditional therapy such as acupuncture, massage 

## Pharmacological Management

Analgesic medications can be broadly classified into 

1. Non-opioids includes e.g. Paracetamol, NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors.
2. Opioids, that can be further classified into 
- Weak opioids (e.g. Tramadol, Codeine, Dihydrocodeine) 
- Strong opioids (e.g. Morphine, Oxycodone, Pethidine, Fentanyl).
3. Other adjuvant medications, used mainly in the management of neuropathic pain include:
- Antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline, duloxetine) 
- Anticonvulsants (e.g. carbamazepine, gabapentin and pregabalin).

Pharmacological agents are used to to provide pain relief and improve the quality of life for the patients as the cornerstone of cancer pain management 

The decision before initiating an analgesic as well as the dose and route of administration would depend on the type and severity of pain.

Other factors to be considered include age, co-morbidities and patient’s adherence. 

A combination of medications may be used. 

It is essential to monitor the patient’s response to the medication while minimising any AEs in achieving optimal pain control.

### Placebo
- Involves giving a patient a medicine that has no pharmacological effect (e.g. giving an injection of saline for pain). 
- Because psychological factors are very important, the patient’s pain may improve. 
- If it works, this does not mean the patient did not have pain in the first place or that the patient was lying! 

## Principles of Analgesic Management

1. By mouth 
- Analgesic medication should be given by mouth whenever possible.

2. By the clock 
- Doses of analgesic medication should be given at fixed intervals around-the-clock. 
- The aim is for the next dose to be given before the previous dose effect has worn off. 

3. For the individual 
- As each patient is unique and different, analgesic therapy should be individualised.
- This is based on the type of pain, response to medication, AE etc. 

4. Attention to detail 
- Prescription timing should consider the patient’s day and sleep schedule. 
- Education on the use of these medications should be given including effects and AEs.

## Weak Opiods

Used for mild to moderate pain in WHO Cancer Ladder Step 2

Examples of drug
- Tramadol
- Dihydrocodeine 
- Codeine

## Strong Opiods

Recommended to be used for moderate to severe pain

Examples of drug

- Morphine
- Fentanyl
- Oxycodone

Oral morphine is an effective analgesic for moderate to severe cancer pain, and should be the first choice of treatment in moderate to severe cancer pain.

Morphine (either Immediate Release/ Sustained Release)

Should be used to maintain effective and safe pain relief in cancer pain. 

Should be used as rescue medicine with either formulation

## Morphine

Potent analgesic agent – the “gold standard” opioid analgesic

Bioavailability of oral route is 30% due to first pass effect (metabolized in liver)  

Elimination half-life is 3-4 hours, excreted via kidney 

So, need to be cautious in patients with impaired liver and/or renal functions 

Peak analgesic effect: 
- IM / SC: 30 minutes 
- IV: 5 minutes

## Opioid Initiation and Titration

Titrated according to individual analgesic response and occurrence of adverse events

To achieve optimal pain relieve with minimal adverse events

Initiated at the dose of 5 - 10 mg 4-hourly using the oral IR formulation

In elderly, start with a lower dose of 2.5 - 5 mg 4 - 6-hourly of the IR formulation

May consider rapid titration using IV or SC morphine in patients presenting with severe cancer pain for initial pain control.

No maximum dose for strong opioids in cancer pain management.

Alternative methods of administration for severe cancer pain:
- 4-hourly parenteral morphine/oxycodone 
- Continous parenteral opioid infusion 

Once pain control is optimised, may consider switching to SR formulation

Long-term use of opioids must not be abruptly discontinued to avoid withdrawal.

Tapering opioid therapy must be conducted in a stepwise fashion, involving patients throughout the process.

## Trivia 1

What will be his new requirement for adequate pain control?

[( )] 5 mg/ 4 hourly
[(X)] 7 mg / 4 hourly
[( )] 10 mg / 4 hourly

## Trivia 2

Please convert syrup morphine 10 mg Q4H to a continuous IV infusion.

[( )] 200 mg / 24h 
[(X)] 20 mg / 24h
[( )] 60 mg / 24h

## Breakthrough Pain Management

Subtypes of breakthrough pain

1. Incident Pain
Pain triggered by certain activity such as movement

2. Spontaneous Pain
Sudden with no identifiable source

End of dose failure 
- Medication effect wears off before the next scheduled analgesic dose 
- May be attributed to inadequate analgesic doses or dose intervals exceeding the medication’s duration of minimum effective plasma level for pain control.

## Opioid Adverse Effects

Dose effect relationship, where higher rate of AE with higher doses

Need to be monitored to ensure compliance and optimal pain control

Management includes
- Recognition of adverse effects 
- Adjustment of opioid dosages
- Symptomatic management of certain adverse effects

In the management of cancer pain for older patients or those with
renal/liver impairment:
- All opioids should be used with caution.
- Adjustment in doses/frequency of opioids should be considered to avoid toxicity. 

## Opioid Toxicity

### Respiratory Depression

Very rare event, happens during rapid titration of opioid

Uncommon during chronic administration

When appropriately titrated against the patient’s pain, strong opioids do not cause clinically important respiratory depression. 

Sedation assessment is a good early clinical indicator of opioid-induced respiratory depression

If severe respiratory depression with respiratory rate of < 8x/ minute occurs, low doses of naloxone at 40 mcg (0.04 mg) can be used and titrated every 1 - 3 minutes against the patient’s respiratory rate. 

Large bolus doses of naloxone should not be given as it reverses the analgesic effects and causes major physical withdrawal syndromes, leading to breakthrough pain

## Opioids Tolerance and Addiction

### Opioid Tolerance
Long term body adaptation to opioids resulting in reduced clinical effectiveness of opioids with repeated use at the same dose.

Fear of opioid tolerance should not cause any hesitation to start or increase opioid therapy for cancer patients experiencing pain.

### Opioid Addiction
Defined as a chronic neurobiologic disease, characterized by behaviors that include 

1. Impaired control over drug use
2. Compulsive use
3. Continued use despite harm
4. Craving

## Alternative Therapy

1. Biphosphonates in treating bone pain

2. Antidepressants 
- Tricyclic antidepressants 
- Amitriptyline 
- Nortriptyline 

3. Anticonvulsants
- Carbamazepine 
- Gabapentin 
- Pregabalin

4. Corticosteroids such as Dexamethasone

5. Radiotherapy

6. Palliative Chemotherapy
